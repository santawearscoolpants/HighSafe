🔧 Development Roadmap for HighSafe (24 Days)

🛠️ Component Recap

    Microcontroller: ESP32 LILYGO T-Call (SIM800L built-in)

    Sensors: MPU6050 (motion), NEO-7M (GPS), optional vibration sensor

    Power: TP4056, LM2596 Buck, 18650 Batteries

    Interface: OLED (128x64), pushbuttons, RGB LED

    Others: Jumpers, resistors, switches, buzzer, temp sensor


Done: ✅ 

🔁 Week 1 – Power & Core Hardware Setup

    Day 1–2:
    ✅ Test 18650 batteries with TP4056 charging module
    ✅ Ensure safety (do not short)
    ✅ Confirm full charging and protection features

    Day 3:
    ✅ Connect LM2596 Buck Converter
    ✅ Step down voltage to 5V and 3.3V
    ✅ Power up basic components like LEDs and Buzzers

    Day 4:
    ✅ Test ESP32 Board vs TTGO T-Call
    ✅ Upload basic “Hello World” or LED blink code
    ✅ Compare functionality & GSM capability
    ✅ Decide which one to proceed with

    Day 5:
    ✅ Connect and test NEO-7M GPS Module
    ✅ Get and print location coordinates
    ✅ Test update rate and serial communication

    Day 6–7:
    Connect GPS to GSM (TTGO or SIM800L)
    On button press, send SMS with GPS location and timestamp
    Basic SIM setup and serial communication tests
    Test both modules (if ESP32+SIM800L fails, use external GSM)

⚙️ Week 2 – Sensor Integration & Data Capture

    Day 8–9:
    Connect and calibrate MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyro)
    Use motion detection library
    Identify crash events based on G-force thresholds

    Day 10:
    Implement button interrupt logic
    One for Robbery
    One for false alarm override within 10 seconds

    Day 11:
    Combine crash detection + countdown + SMS
    If crash detected, buzzer beeps + timer
    If no override in 10s, sends emergency alert

    Day 12–13:
    Connect Temperature Sensor + RGB LED + buzzer
    RGB for status (Green: Safe, Red: Alert, Blue: Robbery)
    Buzzer for feedback
    Temperature for additional data (optional now)

    Day 14:
    OLED Display
    Show battery level, signal strength, GPS status

🧠 Week 3 – System Integration

    Day 15–16:
    Integrate all modules
    Power, GPS, GSM, MPU6050, Display, Buttons

    Day 17:
    Stress test system
    Check performance under real use
    Test alerts (SMS, time delay, edge cases)

    Day 18:
    Prototype crash simulation (shake/crash test manually)

    Day 19:
    Fine-tune thresholds, delays, UI display

💻 Week 4 – Polishing & Documentation

    Day 20–21:
    Create final Fritzing schematic
    Label all components
    Add power source notes and wiring clarity

    Day 22:
    Clean up code, write comments, and prepare documentation

    Day 23:
    Push everything to GitHub Repo
    Code, schematics, images, parts list, build instructions

    Day 24:
    🧪 Final review + practice demo/pitch
