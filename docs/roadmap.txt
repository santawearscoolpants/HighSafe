🔧 Development Roadmap for HighSafe (24 Days)
🔁 Week 1 – Power & Core Hardware Setup

    Day 1–2:
    ✅ Test 18650 batteries with TP4056 charging module
    ✅ Ensure safety (do not short)
    ✅ Confirm full charging and protection features

    Day 3:
    🔌 Connect LM2596 Buck Converter
    ✅ Step down voltage to 5V and 3.3V
    ✅ Power up basic components like LEDs and Buzzers

    Day 4:
    🧠 Test ESP32 Board vs TTGO T-Call
    ✅ Upload basic “Hello World” or LED blink code
    ✅ Compare functionality & GSM capability
    ✅ Decide which one to proceed with

    Day 5:
    🧭 Connect and test NEO-7M GPS Module
    ✅ Get and print location coordinates
    ✅ Test update rate and serial communication

    Day 6–7:
    🛰️ Connect GPS to GSM (TTGO or SIM800L)
    ✅ On button press, send SMS with GPS location and timestamp
    ✅ Basic SIM setup and serial communication tests
    ✅ Test both modules (if ESP32+SIM800L fails, use external GSM)

⚙️ Week 2 – Sensor Integration & Data Capture

    Day 8–9:
    🚗 Connect and calibrate MPU6050 (accelerometer + gyro)
    ✅ Use motion detection library
    ✅ Identify crash events based on G-force thresholds

    Day 10:
    🔘 Implement button interrupt logic
    ✅ One for Robbery
    ✅ One for false alarm override within 10 seconds

    Day 11:
    🎯 Combine crash detection + countdown + SMS
    ✅ If crash detected, buzzer beeps + timer
    ✅ If no override in 10s, sends emergency alert

    Day 12–13:
    🌡️ Connect Temperature Sensor + RGB LED + buzzer
    ✅ RGB for status (Green: Safe, Red: Alert, Blue: Robbery)
    ✅ Buzzer for feedback
    ✅ Temperature for additional data (optional now)

    Day 14:
    🖥️ OLED Display
    ✅ Show battery level, signal strength, GPS status

🧠 Week 3 – System Integration

    Day 15–16:
    🔄 Integrate all modules
    ✅ Power, GPS, GSM, MPU6050, Display, Buttons

    Day 17:
    🔁 Stress test system
    ✅ Check performance under real use
    ✅ Test alerts (SMS, time delay, edge cases)

    Day 18:
    🧪 Prototype crash simulation (shake/crash test manually)

    Day 19:
    🔄 Fine-tune thresholds, delays, UI display

💻 Week 4 – Polishing & Documentation

    Day 20–21:
    📐 Create final Fritzing schematic
    ✅ Label all components
    ✅ Add power source notes and wiring clarity

    Day 22:
    🧾 Clean up code, write comments, and prepare documentation

    Day 23:
    📁 Push everything to GitHub Repo
    ✅ Code, schematics, images, parts list, build instructions

    Day 24:
    🧪 Final review + practice demo/pitch
